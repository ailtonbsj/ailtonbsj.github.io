The version actual of WPS Office is so much compatible with MS Office and is a good alternative for to use in Linux systems as like the Libre Office.

However the installation for using in Brazil is complex because need to install several packages. The package debian also generate conflicts with PDF thumbnails of somes distros.

Therefore I decided to fork the package from WPS community and change to add the language and fix the thumbnails of Lubuntu system that use LXDE.
